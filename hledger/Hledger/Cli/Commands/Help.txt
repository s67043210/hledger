help

Show the hledger user manual with info, man, or a pager. With a (case
insensitive) TOPIC argument, try to open it at that section heading.

Flags:
  -i                       show the manual with info
  -m                       show the manual with man
  -p                       show the manual with $PAGER or less
                           (less is always used if TOPIC is specified)

This command shows the hledger manual built in to your hledger
executable. It can be useful when offline, or when you prefer the
terminal to a web browser, or when the appropriate hledger manual or
viewers are not installed properly on your system.

By default it chooses the best viewer found in $PATH, trying in this
order: info, man, $PAGER, less, more, stdout. (If a TOPIC is specified,
$PAGER and more are not tried.) You can force the use of info, man, or a
pager with the -i, -m, or -p flags. If no viewer can be found, or if
running non-interactively, it just prints the manual to stdout.

When using info, TOPIC can match either the full heading or a prefix. If
your info --version is < 6, you'll need to upgrade it, eg with
'brew install texinfo' on mac.

When using man or less, TOPIC must match the full heading. For a prefix
match, you can write 'TOPIC.*'.

Examples

$ hledger help -h                 # show the help command's usage
$ hledger help                    # show the manual with info, man or $PAGER
$ hledger help 'time periods'     # show the manual's "Time periods" topic
$ hledger help 'time periods' -m  # use man, even if info is installed
